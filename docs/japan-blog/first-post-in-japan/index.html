<p>I am finally in Japan! This is the first of many blog posts where I will attempt to
update everyone on my adventures. I hope this will help me keep in touch and maybe share some of
my Japan experience along the way!</p>
<h2 id="getting-settled">Getting Settled</h2>
<p>I landed in Japan on the 3rd of July at around 8:30 PM and was through customs by 9.
My first apartment of the trip was located near Motohasunuma Station. Narita, where
the airport is located, is basically all the way out in the boondocks and I was frazzled
from my long day of traveling which lead to a somewhat stressful first night. I wanted to
get to the apartment and sleep. I caught a limited express train from the airport to Nippori Station
that would arrive around 10:30 PM. The plan was to take that train to Nippori, another to Sugamo,
and finally transfer to one bound for Motohasunuma.</p>

</figure>

<p>If you’ve never been to Tokyo, there are more train lines than I think anyone could possibly
remember. Riding the express train in, my exhaustion beginning to take over, we pulled
into Sugano station much earlier than I had expected. “Hooray!”, I thought! I can cut off a
transfer and save some time! This was the first reality check on my language skills.
Subtle to the sleepy brain, Sugamo and Sugano are not the same place (haha). Now I was stuck
between Narita and Nippori waiting for a local line to take me in.</p>

<p>Eventually a local train did arrive, and I was able to make it to the Motohasunuma Station a
little after midnight. With the Google maps pin loaded in my phone, I was eager to get settled
in my new place. The pin I was given in an email was not the actual address, however, so I spent
close to an hour wandering around the neighborhood near the station with my bags in a sleepy stupor
until Kim managed to direct me to the correct spot (thank goodness). The apartment itself was small,
but I found it easy to get settled. The next week was relatively relaxing. I was able to explore a
few neighborhoods in Tokyo, meet up with my soon-to-be coworkers for drinks and karaoke, and get
adjusted to the time difference.</p>
<p>My Japanese, rusty though it is, began jumping back into my brain!
My main concerns were getting my Visa processed so I could start working and just generally surviving. The majority
of this first week was devoted to running errands to accomplish these tasks. I needed to get an
<span class="more-info">
  Inkan
  <span class="more-info-text">An Inkan is a personalized stamp (Mine is shown above) which is used in Japan in place of a signature for most things!</span>
</span>

and to help the legal team with the information they needed. I also needed more basic things like
toothpaste and body wash. The brands in japan are virtually unrecognizable and I’m worried I my
not have been using actual toothpaste for the first few brushes! I did eventually sort everything
out and I learned quite a few new words along the way.</p>
<p>##Kim&rsquo;s Visit</p>
<p>Kim landed on the 10th at Haneda airport. Haneda is much closer to the actual city,
so I suggested she land there to avoid some of the craziness of the trip in from Narita
(advice I probably should have heeded as well). Her plane arrived close to midnight and
I was boiling over with anticipation and excitement. Needless to say it was amazing to
be reunited and we hurried to the last open SIM card store to try to get her phone to
work. One thing to know about Kimberly is that she will help people even when it’s not
in her best interest (haha). Without going to deep into the details we burned about a
half hour trying to help a girl activate her phone and ultimately missed the last train.
It was not all bad though, this lead to our first experience with Japanese Taxis.

Uber/Lyft are basically <span class="more-info">

</span>
 in Japan. We downloaded the
JapanTaxi app and were quickly connected with a driver. Japanese taxis are impressively clean
and professional; it felt more like we were being chauffeured! Driving through Tokyo at night
really gives you an appreciation of the scale and intricacies of fitting so many people in so
small a space. Highways  and train tracks cut through around around skyscrapers.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The next day we visited my soon-to-be office building and Kim was able to see the impressive
view from my desk. I&rsquo;m not sure how I got lucky enough to have a corner desk, but I’m looking forward to
staring out at this scenery! I had a few errands to run in Shibuya so we made a day of it.
Shibuya is basically the Times Square of Tokyo. There are high rise shopping centers lining the
streets and an iconic intersection where hundreds of people cross in many directions. After
visiting the statue of Hachiko, we made our way to Akihabara to explore the so called “Electric Town”.</p>

Akihabara is a section of Tokyo that originally became known as the Electric Town after World War II when
it became a major market place for household electronics. The black market also thrived in the area making
it an entrepreneurial epicenter. Nowadays, it is a neon street, plastered wall to wall with advertisements,
collectibles, and electronics. It has embraced

interests, selling everything from trading cards to statues. Kim and I explored the arcades and played a few
rhythm games (think Dance Dance Revolution with a modern twist). Finally, we decided to try our luck at
one of the many claw machine stores. These shops contain dozens of claw machines with various prizes. Just as
we were beginning to think we didn&rsquo;t have a chance, we won our new stuffed Shibe friendo and decided to call it a night.</p>

The next day we visited Meiji-Jingu, a famous Shinto shrine near Harajuku, where we bought Omamori
charms and prayed in the traditional fashion. Following that, we visited the imperial palace and took
pictures looking up at the white walls that glimmered in the moats that surrounded the palace grounds.
We rounded off our day with a few bowls of delicious ramen noodles at a super friendly, neighborhood
noodle shop before turning in. Next stop, Kyoto.
In the morning we cleaned up the room and packed. We set out on the 9:30 bullet train to Kyoto.
We arrived a little after lunch, and after checking into our hotel, decided to wander around an
open air market until dinner. We ate dinner at a hip local

</span>

called Gion Kappa
which I would highly recommend. We tried out all sorts of dishes and were not disappointed by any of them!
We visited the Yasaka shrine and then drank Chu-hi&rsquo;s (shochu highballs) by the river as the sun set.</p>
