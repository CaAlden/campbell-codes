<p>Hello all! It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve written one of these, so I wanted to give
a quick heads up about what I&rsquo;m planning to do going forward. I have decided that
trying to catch everyone up with what I&rsquo;ve been doing since my last post in July would
be virtually impossible. Instead, I am going to try to put out a much smaller post roughly
weekly with the hope that I can balance interesting stories with a work load that I can
realistically accomplish.</p>
<h1 id="ameya-yokochou-hahahugoshortcode-s1-hbhb">Ameya Yokochou (<span class="japanese">アメヤ横丁</span>
)</h1>
<p>This weekend I decided to take a trip up to a
<span class="more-info">
  Shoutengai
  <span class="more-info-text">A word basically meaning, &#39;market street&#39;. An outdoor market.</span>
</span>

in Ueno, Tokyo, called Ameya Yokochou (Ameyoko for short). After about an hour long train ride, I arrived at
the market and was surprised by its somewhat local vibe. It felt like a larger, but more managable version of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takeshita_Street">Takeshita Dori</a> (probably because it is a full market instead of just one, busy street). I actually live near an
even more local-oriented shoutengai, but it has primarily household goods and a few restaurants.</p>
<p>Ameyoko instantly felt like a perfect middleground between the two types of market.
It was big enough to have large groups of people, but they all seemed to be there for a reason aside from siteseeing.</p>

<p>The market is about 3 blocks wide, and runs the distance between the Ueno and Okachimachi stations.
As I meandered down each street, I was overwhelmed with all of the food options. Hoards of people
lined up in front of the tiny shops that were set back a short distance from the main thoroughfare.
Each shop seemed to specialize in someway to set itself apart from the rest. One even had a giant, mechanical bowl of
noodles to entice passersby. Eventually, I found
a stand selling
<span class="more-info">
  Takoyaki
  <span class="more-info-text">Fried Octopus Balls: chunks of octopus, battered in savory pancake mix, and fried (yum)!</span>
</span>

(pictured in the center below), which I finished as I explored a bit more.</p>

<p>Another motivation for coming to Ameyoko was a small bar I had read about called
Mr. Kanso. The bar is normal in most ways, except that all of the food they serve comes from
cans. If you initially react to that premise with skepticism, you&rsquo;re not alone, but the reviews
claimed it was well worth a visit. I checked my phone, and it was only a block away so I decided to give it a shot.</p>
<p>After being seated, the bartender explained that I could pick any can from the wall behind me,
and he would prepare and serve it. He also mentioned that he could suggest a pairing if I was unsure.
As I was perusing the selection, I noticed some more exotic options (including bear?! and horse), and decided
to pick for myself. I ended up choosing Sardines which paired well with the Japanese beer I&rsquo;d chosen to start with.</p>
<p>The bar was a fairly local spot, and ended up being a great place to practice speaking Japanese. The person
next to me had been living in German until a few months ago, and wanted a chance to practice English.
An ad hoc language exchange ensued, and we had a entertaining time trying to decypher what the other was saying.
I had one last drink, and decided to call it a night.</p>

It was nice to visit a place like Ameyoko. I think if I was not living here, it would not have been high enough on
the list of need-to-see places to make the cut. It was fun to share about in this shorter post! Hopefully I can use
these smaller ones to paint a more vivid picture of what daily life is like for me in Japan!</p>
